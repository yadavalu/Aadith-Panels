        <h3>Project 1: Solar Panel System Design and Installation for Radha-Govinda Temple</h3>
        <p>Radha-Govinda Temple is a famous Hindu Temple in Berlin, known for its vibrant festivals. These festivals however come with their cost: high electricity bills and high carbon footprint. Installing solar panels was the ideal solution to both reduce the costs as well as a fall in the carbon emissions.</p>
